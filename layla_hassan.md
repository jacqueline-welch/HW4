# Layla Hassan

Layla Hassan (1984 – 2020) was a member of the [Assassin Brotherhood](assassin_brotherhood.md) and a former employee of [Abstergo Industries](abstergo.md). Forced to leave Abstergo following a [Templar](templar_order.md) attempt on her life, she was offered a position within the Assassins by their leader, William Miles, the father of [Desmond Miles](desmond_miles.md).

Though initially reluctant, Layla eventually joined the Assassins and became an important member of the Brotherhood, taking control of her own Assassin cell within a year.
