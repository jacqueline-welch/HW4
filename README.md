_Assassin's Creed_ is a historical action-adventure video game series developed mainly by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. The series depicts a fictional millennia-old struggle between the [Order of Assassins](order_of_assassins.md), who fight for peace and free will, and the [Knight's Templar](knights_templar.md), who desire power through order and control. The series features historical fiction, science fiction, and fictional characters intertwined with real-world historical events and historical figures. In most games, players control an historical Assassin in a specific time period while also playing as an Assassin Initiate in the present day, switching between the two as the game progresses.

There are fourteen major installments in the series. The first [Assassin's Creed](ac.md) game was released in 2007, and the most recent was [Assassin's Creed Shadows](ac_shadows.md) in 2025. Main games in the series are set in an open world and are played in third-person view. Gameplay revolves around combat, stealth, and exploration, including the use of parkour to navigate the environment. The games feature both main and side missions, and some titles also include competitive and cooperative multiplayer game modes.

The first five main games follow [Desmond Miles](desmond_miles.md), a descendant of several important Assassins throughout history, who uses a machine called the [Animus](animus.md) to relive his ancestor's memories and find powerful artifacts called [Pieces of Eden](pieces_of_eden.md) in an attempt to prevent a catastrophic world-ending event. From [Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag](ac4.md) to [Assassin's Creed Syndicate](acs.md), Assassin Initiates and employees of [Abstergo Industries](abstergo.md) record genetic memories using the [Helix software](helix.md), helping the Templars and Assassins find new Pieces of Eden in the modern world. The next three games, [Origins](ac_origins.md), [Odyssey](ac_odyssey.md), and [Valhalla](acv.md), follow ex-Abstergo employee [Layla Hassan](layla_hassan.md) on her own quest to save humanity from another disaster.
