> —Ezio Auditore and Minerva, on the nature of the Isu, 1499.

The Isu are an ancient and highly-advanced species of humanoid beings who were active on Earth during the eponymous era several millennia before the rise of even the most ancient human civilizations. The Isu were responsible for the creation of the [Pieces of Eden](pieces_of_eden.md), powerful artifacts and weapons that augmented their already-superhuman abilities, as well as forming the human race itself.

Their history shrouded in mystery, the Isu ruled over Earth roughly 77,000 years ago before they were largely wiped out, alongside many of their human creations, during the Great Catastrophe. By that point, the Isu had been in a decade-long war with a human rebellion led by two hybrids, Adam and Eve, who sought to free humanity from servitude to their "gods".

Following the Great Catastrophe, the Isu population rapidly declined to the point of near extinction within the century, but their legacy would live on for thousands of years through myth and legend, becoming the focal point of many human religions, whether polytheistic or monotheistic. Further still, those Pieces of Eden that survived the Great Catastrophe also influenced early man's development and eventually became a pivotal desire for both the [Templar Order](templar_order.md) and the [Assassin Brotherhood](assassin_brotherhood.md), who waged a war of their own for control of the Pieces, and by extension humanity's future.
