# Desmond Miles

Desmond Miles (13 March 1987 - 21 December 2012) is the protagonist of five [*Assassin's Creed*](README.md) installments, with his journey uniting the frame story of the first five installments. He is a descendant of a long line of important characters, including Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad, Ezio Auditore da Firenze, Edward Kenway, and Ratonhnhaké:ton / Connor, who were all members of the [Assassin Brotherhood](assassin_brotherhood.md), a fictional organization inspired by the real-life Order of Assassins that is dedicated to safeguarding peace and freedom.

Born into the Brotherhood, Desmond is trained as an Assassin from a young age, but his desire to lead a normal life eventually prompts him to run away from home and cut ties with the Assassins. However, he is eventually kidnapped by the [Templar Order](templar_order.md), the Assassins' mortal enemies, who force him into a machine called the [Animus](animus.md) that allows Desmond to experience the genetic memories of his ancestors. In doing so, the Templars hope to locate powerful artifacts called [Pieces of Eden](pieces_of_eden.md) and enslave all of humanity. Desmond manages to escape and, after accepting his Assassin heritage, rejoins the Brotherhood to help them stop the Templars. In the process, he learns that he is destined to save humanity from an impending solar flare, and continues to explore his ancestors' memories to find the technology of a precursor race called the [Isu](isu.md), who were wiped out by a similar disaster.
