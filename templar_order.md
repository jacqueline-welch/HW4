# Templar Order

The Templar Order seen in the *Assassin's Creed* game series is based on the real Knight's Templar, which were a military order of the Catholic faith founded in 1118 CE to defend pilgrims on their way to Jerusalem. Their headquarters were located on the Temple Mount and they existed for nearly two centuries during the Middle Ages.

In the game series, they are portrayed as the main antagonist, with members of the order throughout history seeking power and control by using the [Pieces of Eden](pieces_of_eden.md).
