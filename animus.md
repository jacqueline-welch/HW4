# Animus


The Animus (plural: Animi) is a virtual reality machine developed, and eventually commercialized, by [Abstergo Industries](abstergo.md). It allows the user to read a host's genetic memory and project the output onto an external screen in three dimensions.

The machine was notably used in Abstergo's Animus Project and the Animi Training Program. The former analyzed the genetic memories of several select subjects, usually to gain information on the [Assassin Brotherhood](assassin_brotherhood.md) or [Pieces of Eden](pieces_of_eden.md), while the latter was used for the training of Abstergo employees.

A newer model of the Animus, known as the Animus Omega, was distributed commercially by Abstergo as an entertainment console. It was compatible with video games consisting of recorded memories, and was intended to be used to influence the general public on the behalf of the [Templars](templar_order.md).
