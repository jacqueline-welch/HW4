# Abstergo Industries

Abstergo Industries is a multinational corporate conglomerate, and the primary front for the modern-day activities of the [Templar Order](templar_order.md). One of the largest and most prominent corporations in the world, Abstergo and its predecessors were responsible for the majority of human technological development for the past millennia.

Despite genuinely contributing to the technological development of society, Abstergo Industries' primary mission, as dictated by its Templar members, was the destruction of the [Assassin Order](assassin_brotherhood.md), the procurement of advanced technologies originally created by the Isu ([Pieces of Eden](pieces_of_eden.md)), and the establishment a New World Order.
