# Helix software

Helix is a cloud-based software developed by Abstergo Entertainment, a subsidiary of [Abstergo Industries](abstergo.md). The Helix software allowed users to view accounts of various [Templars](templar_order.md) and [Assassins](assassin_brotherhood.md) throughout history, with propaganda-based narrations delivered by Abstergo in favor of the former, delivered to the public via a games console-style format.

Through Helix, a research analyst at Abstergo Entertainment relived Shay Cormac's memories and fixed the damage caused by a virus hidden within Shay's memory bank ([*Assassin's Creed Rogue*](ac_rogue.md)).

An individual associated with the Assassins used a game console running the Helix software to relive the memories of Arno Dorian ([*Assassin's Creed: Unity*](acu.md)), and later those of Jacob and Evie Frye ([*Assassin's Creed Syndicate*](acs.md)).
